## Features
- The functional PCB is shared by both front pannels
- There is a battery connector for KOSMO sized modules
- On Eurorack the power connection is made directly with pins (NICE!)
- The modules can share power (3:1) to save some components and prescious power bus connections
- The modules can be Linked inside the case for cleaner setups. The internal link is switchable

## Limitations
- if you order the front pannels from JLC there are problems with edge cuts not showing in the preview. I usualy drop them a note to doublecheck. it works!
- the functional back PCB has internal sub pannels (battery connector & bridges), they add an extra charge for that :(
- if you build the battery connector you have to wrap some wire around the conatact areas an connect it to the footprints (+ & G). don't worry about the standoffs (small t-shaped sub builds), they are not needed.

## Famous last Words:

have FUN and don't blame me if you fry your PO ;)
